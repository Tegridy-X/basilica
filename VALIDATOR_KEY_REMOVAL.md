# Validator Public Key Removal Documentation

## Overview
The validator public key requirement has been completely removed from the gpu-attestor build process. Previously, building gpu-attestor required providing a validator public key at compile time, which was embedded into the binary. This has been simplified - the binary now builds without any key requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Build System Changes

#### `crates/gpu-attestor/build.rs`
- Removed the `embed_validator_key()` function entirely
- Removed the requirement for `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY` environment variable
- No longer generates `embedded_keys.rs` in the build output

### 2. Source Code Changes

#### `crates/gpu-attestor/src/integrity.rs`
- Removed `extract_embedded_key()` function
- Removed the embedded key module inclusion
- Removed public export of `EMBEDDED_VALIDATOR_KEY`
- Updated tests to remove key extraction test

#### `crates/gpu-attestor/src/attestation/signer.rs`
- Removed `get_embedded_validator_key()` method
- Removed `validate_against_embedded_key()` method
- Renamed remaining validation method to `validate_attestation()`
- Updated tests to remove embedded key validation tests

#### `crates/gpu-attestor/src/main.rs`
- Removed import of `extract_embedded_key`
- Updated `verify_binary_integrity()` to not check for embedded key
- Changed attestation builder to use "self-signed" instead of embedded key
- Updated main function to use "self-signed" attestations

#### `crates/gpu-attestor/src/lib.rs`
- Removed public export of `extract_embedded_key`

### 3. Build Script Changes

#### `scripts/gpu-attestor/build.sh`
- Removed `--key` parameter handling (kept for backward compatibility but ignored)
- Removed key validation logic
- Removed automatic key detection from files
- Updated help text to remove key parameter

#### `scripts/gpu-attestor/Dockerfile`
- Removed `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY` ARG and ENV declarations
- Removed key validation checks

### 4. Docker Changes

#### `docker/executor.Dockerfile`
- Removed key generation step
- Removed copying of public_key.hex
- Simplified startup script to not read validator key

#### `docker/miner.Dockerfile`
- Removed key generation step
- Removed `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY_FILE` environment variable

### 5. Documentation Updates

#### `docs/quickstart.md`
- Removed the "Build Error - Missing Validator Key" section
- Added simple build instructions without key requirement

#### `docs/validator.md`
- Simplified build instructions to just `cargo build -p validator`
- Removed all mentions of validator key requirements

#### `scripts/README.md`
- Updated GPU Attestor build instructions to not require key export

### 6. Test Updates

#### `crates/integration-tests/tests/gpu_pow_e2e.rs`
- Updated error message to not mention `VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY`

## Migration Guide

### For Users Building gpu-attestor

Before:
```bash
# Generate key
./scripts/gen-key.sh
# Build with key
VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY=$(cat public_key.hex) cargo build --bin gpu-attestor
```

After:
```bash
# Just build - no key needed!
cargo build --bin gpu-attestor
```

### For Docker Builds

Before:
```bash
docker build --build-arg VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY="<key>" -f scripts/gpu-attestor/Dockerfile .
```

After:
```bash
docker build -f scripts/gpu-attestor/Dockerfile .
```

### For CI/CD Systems

Remove any steps that:
- Generate validator keys before building gpu-attestor
- Set VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY environment variable
- Pass validator keys as build arguments

## Security Implications

The embedded validator key was not being used for actual signature verification in the current implementation. The attestation system uses ephemeral keys for signing, and the embedded key was essentially a placeholder. Removing it:

1. **Simplifies the build process** - No need to manage keys at build time
2. **Improves security** - No keys embedded in binaries
3. **Maintains functionality** - All attestation features work as before

The attestation system continues to use ephemeral key pairs generated at runtime for signing attestations.

## Backward Compatibility

The build scripts still accept the `--key` parameter for backward compatibility but simply ignore it. This ensures existing build pipelines won't break immediately.

## Testing

The system has been tested and builds successfully without the validator key requirement:
```
cargo build --bin gpu-attestor
   Compiling gpu-attestor v0.1.0
   Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 12.18s
```

All GPU PoW functionality remains intact and operational.
